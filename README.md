# simple_calculator

# This is a simple calculator program with fairly bare-bones functionality that is a demonstration of a simple JavaFX layout.
# It is not meant to be a demonstration of deep application design or testing methodologies.

# The core concept of the application design is that the user can use the JavaFX controls to enter simple calculations;
# These inputs are converted to text and reflected in a Text Area.
# Simple validation is performed on the text, and then the text is converted to Double and then the calculation is performed
# The results are displayed in the text field, and the results are appended to the text area, so the user can view all of their  previous calculations.

# Thank you for reading.
